--
1) This covers SQL analytical functions: ANK(), DENSE_RANK and ROW_NUMBER
2) Let us see all the three
3) There is a sligh difference between each of the 3 functions and we will try and understand the differences
4) These are called as window functions as well as analytical functions sometimes
---
The follwoing concepts are discussed
--
5) We fist create the emp table 
6) We rank ordered by salary descending with highest salary getting best rank 
7) We then use dense_rank. he difference between pue rank and ense_rank() is that dense_rank doesn't skip the rank 
unlike just rank()
8) ROW_NUMBER does not repea anks unlike rank() or dense _rank but if 2 items/ppl have same rank it just randomly 
allocates a number
9) Suppose that we want the rank based on departments we add a clause partition by department_id
10) Let us take another use case wherein we want to get the highest salary in ach department. We do this through a subqury usingg 8 and WHERE clause
